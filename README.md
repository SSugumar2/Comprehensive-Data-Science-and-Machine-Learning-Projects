Data Science Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of data-driven projects I've worked on during my journey as a Data Science enthusiast and intern. Each project showcases my ability to apply statistical techniques, machine learning models, and Excel-based analyses to extract meaningful insights from data.
Featured Projects
1. Predictive Analytics with Machine Learning
A project focused on building and evaluating machine learning models for tasks such as classification and regression using scikit-learn. This includes data pre-processing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning without a focus on data visualizations.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Statistical Techniques
This project emphasizes statistical analysis techniques such as summary statistics, hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis to derive insights from raw datasets. Most of the work was done using Excel for calculations and data manipulation.
3. Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms
Application of unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means clustering to segment customers based on behavioral and demographic attributes. The project utilized Excel and Python to perform data partitioning and analysis without extensive visualizations.
4. Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
An NLP-based project where text was analyzed for sentiment using tokenization, TF-IDF, and statistical sentiment scoring. The machine learning models built focus on sentiment polarity classification (positive/negative), with a minimal use of visualization tools.
5. Time Series Forecasting with Statistical Models
This project uses statistical models such as ARIMA and Prophet for time series forecasting. Emphasis is placed on predictive accuracy and understanding seasonality trends using statistical calculations and Excel rather than visual analysis.
6. Excel-based Financial Analysis
A project demonstrating the application of Excel for advanced financial analysis, including regression techniques, forecasting, and statistical modeling to inform business decisions.
